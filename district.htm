          <p class="card-text";">Kerala is a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile states of Travancore-Cochin and Madras. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the twenty-third largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into <b><i>14 districts</i></b> with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.</p>
          <p>For administrative purposes the State is divided into 14 revenue districts: <b><i>Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanadu, Kannur and Kasaragod.</i></b></p>
          <p>The 14 districts are further divided into 75 Taluks. There are 14 District Panchayats, 152 Block Panchayats, 941 Grama Panchayats, 87 Municipalities, 6 Corporations and 1 Township.
